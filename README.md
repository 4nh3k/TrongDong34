A ferris shape keyboard using XIAO controller, this is my attempt to create a cheap BLE ferris sweep alike. Unfortunately because of the lack of pin on the XIAO controller, this have to use diode. 
# Disclaimer
This is a very buggy design because this is my first PCB design and i don't really have electrical knowledge. Just don't use it.
